I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) who uses machine learning to understand and predict collective dynamics and emergent phenomena in soft matter suspensions. I am currently looking for a new career opportunity in machine learning or data science.

# California Institute of Technology (2016-2020)
Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering  
Advisor: [John F. Brady](https://cce.caltech.edu/people/john-f-brady)  
Thesis: [Density Fluctuations and Machine Learning in Active Matter](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14043/)  

From 2016-2020, I was a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering at Caltech under John Brady. 
The Brady group is known for its theoretical advancement and computer simulation in the areas of complex fluids, colloidal suspensions, and active matter. 
Active matter refers to a material in which each constituent is capable of self-propulsion (i.e. colonies of bacteria, school of fish, or flocks of birds). 
During my time here, I showed how phase behavior in these systems can be predicted with machine learning. Please see my [blog post]() to learn more!

# The University of Texas at Austin (2012-2016)
B.S. in Chemical Engineering (*Honors*)  
Omega Chi Epsilon  
Tau Beta Pi  
Advisors: [Christopher J. Ellison](https://www.cems.umn.edu/people/faculty/christopher-ellison) and [Michael Baldea](https://che.utexas.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/michael-baldea-phd/)

Before starting at Caltech, I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. 
While I was in Austin I had the great privilege to work with some phenomenal people while doing research in experimental polymer physics in Dr. Christopher Ellison's lab. 
I worked on a broad range of topics including thin films with [Reika Katsumata](https://www.pse.umass.edu/faculty/researchgroup/katsumata_), nanopatterning with [Chae Bin Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/cbk-polymer-pnu/home), and nanofiber synthesis with Yichen Fang.
After my time in polymer physics I began working on process control theory, simulation, and optimization with Dr. Michael Baldea as a Moncrief Fellow through the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/). 

# More About Me
As an undergrad at UT Austin, I was a member of Tau Beta Pi (TBP) and Omega Chi Epsilon (OXE). As a social coordinator for OXE, my job was to build a sense of community in the department, facilitate an inclusive environment, and host office hours for other students. I was also a competitor in Austin's ultimate frisbee league ([UPLA](https://austinultimate.org/)) for multiple years.

As a graduate student at Caltech, I became interested in building computers and built several workstations and clusters for the Brady group and Arnold lab.
I also fed my desire to mentor by taking an active role in graduate recruitment each year, mentoring new students in my group, and mentoring an undergraduate student through Caltech's [SURF program](http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf).
As a senior member of the group I was in charge of the computational resources and literature reviews, made and host workshops to improve the computational practices of new group members, and served as the safety coordinator.

Outside of my research interests I am an avid rock climber, hiker, and (more recently) snowboarder.
I also enjoy playing D&D with my wife and colleagues, improv comedy, playing guitar, and drawing.
