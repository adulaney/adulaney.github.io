I'm a computational scientist working at the intersection of machine learning, computer simulation, and soft matter physics. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) in [John Brady's group](https://www.che.caltech.edu/groups/jfb/index.html).

Here's some more information [about me](/about) and [my research](/research). My resume can be found [here](https://github.com/adulaney/resume/blob/main/DulaneyAustin_Resume.pdf).
