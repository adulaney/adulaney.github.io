### Current Research Interests

I am broadly interested in problems that lay at the intersection of physical science and machine learning. Some current topics include:
- Predicting emergent phenomena in complex fluids
- Machine learning for hydrodynamic interactions
- Graph level predictions for supercritical phase phenomena

### PhD Research

My Ph.D. research used machine learning to tackle problems surrounding active matter. 
Active matter is a material in which each consituent can self-propel, such as a colony of bacteria or school of fish. 
Because each consituent can move due to internal stresses, these systems are driven far from equilibrium, rendering most of our first-principle frameworks useless.
I collaborated with scientists in the Brady group to use machine learning to predict complex dynamics in these systems that either can't be done analytically or would be extremely computationally expensive to do via simulation alone. 
I also worked on understanding single-particle dynamics through the development of analytic theory and studied fluctuations in these systems through a combination of theoretical insight and large-scale computational studies.
