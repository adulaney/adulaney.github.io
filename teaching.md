I have TA'd the following courses at Caltech:
- CHE 151a: Physical and Chemical Rate Processes (Winter 2018)
- CHE 151b: Physical and Chemical Rate Processes (Spring 2018)
- CHE 174: Special topics in Transport Phenomena (Fall 2019)

Additionally, I have created some tutorials to help aid students who do computational research applied to the physical sciences.
